# ðŸš€ Setting Up Azure Container Registry (ACR) & Pushing Docker Images  

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction  
As part of my **containerization learning journey**, I explored how to **set up Azure Container Registry (ACR)** to store and manage Docker images. This documentation walks through the exact steps I took to configure **ACR**, push container images, and pull them for deployment in a cloud-native environment.  

By leveraging **ACR**, I can securely store, manage, and deploy containerized applications while integrating with **Kubernetes (AKS)** and CI/CD pipelines.


## ðŸ”¹ Why I Chose ACR  
I wanted a **private, secure** registry to store and manage my Docker images within **Azure**. Compared to public registries like **Docker Hub**, **ACR integrates seamlessly** with **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**, **Azure DevOps**, and **other cloud-native services**.  

### ðŸš€ **What I Achieved in This Lab**
âœ… Set up **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**  
âœ… Built and **tagged Docker images**  
âœ… Pushed images to **ACR**  

## ðŸ“Œ **Prerequisites**
Before I began, I made sure I had the following:
- **Azure CLI** installed (`az --version` to check)
- **Docker** installed (`docker --version` to check)
- An **Azure Subscription** (Sign up [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/) if you donâ€™t have one)

## ðŸ”¹ **Step 1: Manually Creating Azure Container Registry (ACR)**
Instead of using the CLI, I created the ACR manually through the **Azure Portal**:

1. Navigated to **Azure Portal** ([portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/)).
2. Searched for **Container Registry** and clicked **Create**.
3. Filled in the necessary details:
   - **Resource Group**: `RG1`
   - **Registry Name**: `sampleregistry101`
   - **SKU**: `Basic`
4. Clicked **Review + Create**, then **Create**.

## ðŸ”¹ **Step 2: Logging in to Azure and ACR**
After creating the **ACR**, I logged into **Azure** using the **CLI** and authenticated with my **Azure Container Registry**:

```sh
az login
az acr login --name sampleregistry101
```

âœ… **Screenshot of Successful ACR Login:**

## ðŸ”¹ Step 3 & 4: Tagging and Pushing the Docker Image to ACR
Once authenticated, I tagged the **Docker image** to match ACRâ€™s repository format and pushed it to **ACR**.

```sh
docker tag hanadisa/flask-mysql:v1 sampleregistry101.azurecr.io/flask-mysql:v1
```

## ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Verifying the Pushed Image in Azure Portal
After pushing the image, I manually verified its presence in **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** by navigating to:

1) **Azure Portal** â†’ **Container Registries**
2) Selected **sampleRegistry101**
3) Opened the **Repositories** section
4) Found my pushed image **flask-mysql:v1** listed

âœ… **Screenshot of Image Successfully Pushed to ACR:**

## **âœ… Summary**
I successfully completed the following steps:

1) Manually created an **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** in the **Azure Portal**.
2) Logged into **Azure** and authenticated with **ACR** using the **CLI**.
3) Tagged the **Docker image** to match ACRâ€™s naming format.
4) Pushed the **Docker image** to **Azure ACR**.
5) This image is now stored in **Azure ACR** and can be pulled to run in **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**, **Azure App Services**, or other **Azure cloud environments**.
