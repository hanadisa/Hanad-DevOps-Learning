# ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Core Services Notes

Welcome to my Azure Core Services Notes! This document provides an overview of Azure's core services, including compute, storage, and networking. Understanding these services is crucial for anyone looking to leverage Microsoft Azure for cloud computing solutions. Azure is recognized as one of the fastest-growing cloud platforms, making its core services vital for building scalable, reliable, and secure applications.

## üìë Why Azure Core Services are Significant
Azure Core Services encompass the fundamental building blocks of cloud computing, enabling businesses and developers to deploy and manage applications efficiently. By mastering these services, you gain the skills necessary to design robust cloud solutions and understand how to optimize performance and cost.

The Azure ecosystem is vast, and its core services serve various purposes:
- **Compute**: For running applications and processing data.
- **Storage**: For managing large volumes of data securely and efficiently.
- **Networking**: For enabling secure and efficient communication between resources.
