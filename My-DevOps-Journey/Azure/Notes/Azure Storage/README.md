# Azure Storage

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Azure Storage is a fundamental component of cloud computing, enabling scalable, secure, and highly available data storage. It is designed to handle a wide range of workloads, from unstructured data to structured NoSQL storage, message queuing, and file sharing. Azure Storage ensures data durability and redundancy across multiple geographic locations, making it a reliable choice for cloud applications.

This directory covers **Azure Storage**, focusing on the four main types:

- **Blob Storage** â€“ Storing unstructured data (images, videos, backups, etc.)
- **File Storage** â€“ Network file sharing across Azure VMs & applications
- **Queue Storage** â€“ Message-based communication for distributed apps
- **Table Storage** â€“ NoSQL key-value store for structured data

Each storage type serves a specific purpose, allowing businesses and developers to build efficient, cloud-native solutions while ensuring data integrity and accessibility.

## ðŸ“œ Steps to Use Azure Storage in a New Project
In Azure, every time you need to use **Blob, File, Queue, or Table Storage**, you must first create a **Storage Account**. The Storage Account acts as the container for your storage services.

1. **Create a Storage Account** â€“ This is the first step for any storage solution in Azure.
2. **Choose the appropriate storage type** â€“ Select from **Blob, File, Queue, or Table Storage** based on your use case.
3. **Configure access & permissions** â€“ Set up **public/private access, SAS Tokens, or Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for security.
4. **Integrate storage with your project** â€“ Use **Azure CLI, SDKs, Terraform, or other automation tools** to interact with your storage service.

This process ensures **proper storage provisioning, access control, and seamless integration** within cloud-based applications.
