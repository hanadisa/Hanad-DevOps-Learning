# Azure File Storage

## Understanding Azure File Storage
Azure File Storage is a **fully managed cloud file-sharing service** that provides **Server Message Block (SMB) and Network File System (NFS) protocols** for secure and scalable file access. It enables multiple virtual machines (VMs) and applications to **share files seamlessly** without needing on-premises infrastructure.

## 🔹 Key Concepts
- **File Shares** – Logical containers where files are stored, similar to traditional file shares.
- **Storage Account** – The parent entity that holds file shares and other storage resources.
- **Protocols** – Supports **SMB (Windows/Linux)** and **NFS (Linux-only)** for shared file access.
- **Mounting** – File shares can be mounted on **Azure VMs, on-prem servers, and Kubernetes clusters**.

## 💡 When to Use Azure File Storage?
✅ **Shared Storage for VMs** – Provides a centralized file system accessible by multiple Azure VMs.  
✅ **Storing Configuration Files** – Ideal for sharing **configs, logs, and scripts** between applications.  
✅ **Lift & Shift Migrations** – Enables moving on-prem file shares to the cloud with minimal changes.  
✅ **Application Data Sharing** – Allows multiple cloud applications to **read and write files concurrently**.  
✅ **DevOps Use Cases** – Storing **deployment scripts, logs, and persistent storage for containers**.  

## 🔹 Storage Tiers
Azure File Storage provides different performance tiers based on workload requirements:
- **Premium** – High-performance SSD-based file shares for low-latency applications.
- **Transaction Optimized** – Cost-effective option for workloads requiring frequent access.
- **Cool** – Optimized for infrequent access, offering lower-cost storage.
- **Archive** – For rarely accessed data that needs to be retained long-term.

## 🏢 Real-World Use Case: Enterprise Application File Sharing
A **global enterprise** with multiple branch offices needs a **centralized file storage solution** for internal tools and reports. Using **Azure File Storage with SMB**, employees across different locations can **access shared resources seamlessly**, while IT admins enforce access control via **Azure AD authentication**.

## 🛠️ Example Use Case (DevOps Engineer)
A **DevOps Engineer** may use Azure File Storage to:
- Store **deployment scripts** shared across multiple pipelines.
- Mount **Azure File Shares** to containers running in **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**.
- Use **Azure CLI and Terraform** to automate file share provisioning.
- Securely manage **persistent storage for stateful applications**.
