# Azure Networking

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
Azure Networking is the backbone of cloud infrastructure, enabling **secure, scalable, and efficient** communication between resources. It ensures seamless connectivity across Azure services, on-premises environments, and the internet, allowing businesses to build **highly available and resilient applications**.  

With networking, **DevOps engineers** can optimize cloud infrastructure by implementing **secure access, traffic management, and hybrid cloud connectivity**, ensuring smooth operations for applications and services.  

This directory covers **Azure Networking**, focusing on key components:  

- **Virtual Networks (VNets)** â€“ Securely connect and isolate Azure resources within a network.  
- **Subnetting & Routing** â€“ Manage network traffic and segment resources efficiently.  
- **Network Security (NSGs & ASGs)** â€“ Control inbound and outbound traffic for security.  
- **Load Balancing & Traffic Management** â€“ Distribute network traffic efficiently to ensure availability.  
- **DNS & Firewalls** â€“ Manage domain resolution and enforce security policies.  
- **VPN & VNet Peering** â€“ Establish secure connections between networks and hybrid environments.  

Each networking service plays a crucial role in **cloud security, performance, and scalability**, helping DevOps teams design reliable cloud-based infrastructures.  

## ðŸ“œ Steps to Set Up Networking in a New Project  
Before deploying workloads in Azure, setting up a **networking architecture** is crucial. Hereâ€™s the typical process:  

1. **Create a Virtual Network (VNet)** â€“ Defines an isolated network for Azure resources.  
2. **Segment using Subnets** â€“ Organize resources and manage traffic flow.  
3. **Apply Security Controls** â€“ Use **Network Security Groups (NSGs) or Azure Firewall** for traffic filtering.  
4. **Set Up Load Balancing** â€“ Distribute traffic using **Azure Load Balancer or Application Gateway**.  
5. **Configure DNS & Routing** â€“ Ensure efficient name resolution and custom routing rules.  
6. **Enable Hybrid Connectivity** â€“ Use **VPN Gateway or VNet Peering** to link on-premises and cloud networks.  

By following these steps, DevOps teams can **deploy secure, scalable, and resilient network architectures** in Azure.
